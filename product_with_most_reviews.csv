When it arrived I was very impressed with it's construction. The stones are firmly attached and true to the photo's colors. The pendant metal is strong, and I'm not worried about it bending and breaking. The chain seems very sturdy, and held up to my gentle tugging to check it's strength. The ring attaching the pendent to the chain also seems pretty sturdy, and unlikely to break while wearing. The metal is also a nice antique brass, and seems like it will be easy enough to match to earrings. The only think that I think could be improved on would be to put some sort of clasp on the chain. As it is, it is a solid chain, and therefore you must be able to slip it on over your head. It isn't a problem for me at this time, but if I were to have a moderately sized up do, then there could possibly be a problem with getting the necklace on without messing up my hair.

I went and got her another gift and every page I looked at for other items this owl kept following me around.  I finished all my shopping that day and came back to this owl again and said she must have this. I think it grew on her because I got a couple more messages from her saying how much she loves this owl necklace.  She would be totally honest with me and I asked her questions and she said it is beautiful.  So pleased and she got it on the earlier part of the estimated date of arrival which is another 5 star for the seller.
